Hello!

1
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.500
How are you doing? 

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.000 
Testing if the subtitles work for me

3
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.500 
The key is the format

4
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.500 
It must follow the following format:

5
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.500
00:00:00.000 &#45;&#45;&#62; 00:00:00.000

6
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.500
As you can see, it is essential that the format is accurate.

7
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.500
Otherwise you will not get anything u_u

8
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.500
Thanks for everything!
